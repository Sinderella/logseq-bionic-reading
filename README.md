# Bionic Reading plugin for logseq

The plugin relies on [text-vide](https://github.com/Gumball12/text-vide) to transform the paragraph(s). This plugin only introduces 2 slash commands.

- `Bionic Reading: Apply`, apply bionic reading only to the current block
- `Bionic Reading: Apply Recursively`, which includes children blocks
